## System Design & Architecture

### Overview

InterviewIQ is a full-stack web application built with Next.js, Firebase, and advanced AI integrations. The system is modular, scalable, and optimized for real-time interaction and feedback.

### Architecture Components

**Frontend:**

- Next.js (React) for SSR and fast navigation.
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for modern, responsive UI.
- Authentication and interview management via React context and components.

**Backend:**

- Firebase for authentication, database, and storage.
- Next.js API routes for interview creation, feedback, and user management.

**AI Integration:**

- Vapi AI Voice Agents for voice-based interview simulation.
- Google Gemini for advanced AI feedback and transcript analysis.

**Data Flow:**

1. User signs up/signs in via Firebase Authentication.
2. User creates a mock interview session; questions are generated or selected.
3. The interview is conducted via a voice agent (Vapi AI), with real-time transcript and feedback.
4. Feedback and analytics are stored in Firebase and displayed in the user dashboard.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up Firebase and environment variables**
   - Create a Firebase project and enable Authentication and Firestore.
   - Add your credentials to `.env` as described above.
4. **Run locally**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## User Flow

1. **Sign Up:**  
   New users register using their email and password.

2. **Log In:**  
   Users log in to access their dashboard and interview history.

3. **Create Interview Session:**  
   Users select role, level, tech stack, and interview style, then start a new interview.

4. **Interview Simulation:**  
   The Vapi AI voice agent conducts the interview, asking questions generated by Google Gemini.

5. **Feedback & Analytics:**  
   After the interview, Gemini analyzes the transcript and provides detailed feedback and scores, which are saved and shown in the dashboard.

## Design Decisions

- **Modular Components:** UI and logic are split into reusable components for maintainability.
- **Serverless Functions:** Next.js API routes handle backend logic, making deployment easy.
- **AI-Driven Feedback:** Google Gemini provides nuanced, category-based feedback for each interview.
- **Voice Interaction:** Vapi AI enables realistic, voice-based interview practice.
- **Security:** Sensitive keys are stored in `.env` and never exposed in the frontend.
